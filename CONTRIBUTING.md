# Contributing to Explainit

Thank you for considering contributing to Explainit!

## How can you contribute?
We welcome both code and non-code contributions. You can:
* Report a bug
* Improve documentation
* Submit a bug fix
* Propose a new feature or improvement
* Contribute a new feature or improvement
* Test Explainit

## Code contributions
Here is the general workflow:
* Fork the Explainit repository
* Clone the repository
* Make the changes and commit them
* Push the branch to your local fork
* Make sure that all the tests are passing successfully
* Submit a Pull Request with described changes

### Additional information
- Explainit is under active development.
- We are happy to receive a Pull Request for bug fixes or new functions for any section of the app. If you need help or guidance, you can open an Issue first.
- We highly recommend that you open an issue, describe your contribution, share all needed information there and link it to a Pull Request.
- We evaluate Pull Requests taking into account: code architecture and quality, code style, comments & docstrings and coverage by tests.

## 1. Clone repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/explainit/explainit.git
```

## 2. (Optional, but recommended!) Create virtual environment

#### MacOS / Linux
```sh
cd /path/to/explainit_repo
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows
```sh
cd C:\path\to\explainit_repo
py -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

## 3. Use local copy as editable dependency
To use the cloned version in the virtual environment as an app, you need to install the requirements in the editable mode:

#### MacOS / Linux
```sh
cd /path/to/explainit_repo
pip install -e .[dev]
```

#### Windows
```sh
cd C:\path\to\explainit_repo
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## 4. Code-Style--linting

### Conforms to [Black code style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html)
```sh
black explainit
```

### Running flake8
We use flake8 for code style checks.
```sh
flake8 explainit
```

### Running mypy
We use mypy for object types checks.
```sh
# if you are running for the first time, use `mypy --install-types` instead
mypy
```

## 5. Running unit tests
Currently, the project is not fully covered by unit tests, but we are going to add more soon and expect to receive PRs with some unit tests ðŸ™‚
```sh
pytest -v
```

## 6. Signing off commits
>  :warning: Warning: using the default integrations with IDEs like VSCode or IntelliJ will not sign commits. When you submit a PR, you'll have to re-sign commits to pass the DCO check.

Use git signoffs to sign your commits. See https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification for details.

Then, you can sign off commits with the `-s` flag:
```sh
git commit -s -m "My first commit"
```

GPG-signing commits with -S is optional.
